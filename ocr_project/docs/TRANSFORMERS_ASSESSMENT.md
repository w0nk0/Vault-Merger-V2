# Safetensors to GGUF Conversion Assessment

## Quick Summary

**Decision**: **Don't convert** - DeepSeek OCR safetensors model is too complex to convert to GGUF.

**Rationale**: Conversion would require 1-2 days of reverse engineering. Better to either:
1. Use GGUF models (current approach is working)
2. Use DeepSeek OCR's own demo/examples for safetensors models
3. Find alternative OCR models that have GGUF versions

## What Was Attempted

### 1. Conversion Research
- Standard `llama.cpp` conversion tools require `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, etc.
- DeepSeek OCR requires custom modeling files not convertible by standard tools
- Model uses complex image preprocessing (multiple views, cropping, spatial masks)

### 2. Transformers Integration Attempt
✅ **Successfully loaded model** - Model downloads and loads with GPU acceleration  
❌ **Failed at inference** - Custom image preprocessing incompatible with standard VLM pipeline  

### 3. Key Findings
- **Model loads**: Processor, model weights, dependencies all work
- **Image processing fails**: Model expects `images=[(images_crop, images_ori)]` tuples with spatial masks
- **Custom architecture**: Requires special tokenization and multi-view image handling

## Effort Comparison

| Approach | Time Estimate | Complexity | Status |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Safetensors → GGUF | 1-2 days | Very High | ❌ Not recommended |
| Transformers integration | 4-8 hours | High | ⚠️ Partial (loads, but inference needs work) |
| Use GGUF models | ✅ Done | Low | ✅ Working |

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option 1: Stick with GGUF (Recommended)
- ✅ Already working with Gemma 3-12b-it-GGUF
- ✅ GPU acceleration working
- ✅ Text extraction quality: 90%+ according to user
- **Action**: Find more GGUF OCR models or wait for official DeepSeek OCR GGUF release

### Option 2: Use DeepSeek OCR's Official Tools
- Use DeepSeek OCR's own demo/examples from their GitHub repo
- Better support for their custom architecture
- Use safetensors model as-is without conversion

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Keep GGUF as primary (fast, efficient, working)
- Use DeepSeek OCR's official tools for special cases
- Accept that safetensors models stay separate

## Files Modified in This Session

1. **Model files** (fixed imports for standalone use):
   - `/home/nico/LMStudio/deepseekOCR/modeling_deepseekv2.py`
   - `/home/nico/LMStudio/deepseekOCR/modeling_deepseekocr.py`

2. **OCR Project files** (Transformers support attempted):
   - `ocr_project/ocr_engine_transformers.py` (created)
   - `ocr_project/main.py` (model format detection added)
   - `ocr_project/docs/TRANSFORMERS_SUPPORT.md` (initial analysis)

3. **Dependencies installed**:
   - transformers, torch, accelerate, safetensors
   - easydict, matplotlib, torchvision, einops
   - addict

## Next Steps

1. **Keep GGUF as primary solution** ✅
2. **Remove/archive Transformers integration attempt** (not needed)
3. **Update documentation** to clarify GGUF-only support
4. **Focus on improvements** to existing GGUF pipeline:
   - Better text extraction quality (currently 90%)
   - Pan-and-scan improvements
   - Artifact filtering enhancements

---

## Conclusion

**Converting DeepSeek OCR safetensors to GGUF is not practical.** The effort required is disproportionate to the benefit, especially since:

- GGUF pipeline is already working well (90%+ accuracy)
- GPU acceleration is successful
- User can use DeepSeek OCR's official tools for safetensors models
- Alternative GGUF OCR models may become available

**Recommendation: Keep GGUF as primary and use DeepSeek OCR's official tools for safetensors needs.**
