# Transformers Support - Assessment Summary

## Status: ⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED

Transformers/safetensors support was attempted but found to be **not practical** for DeepSeek OCR.

---

## Why It Doesn't Work

The DeepSeek OCR safetensors model requires:
1. **Complex image preprocessing** - Multiple views, cropping, spatial masks
2. **Custom input format** - Images as tuples `[(images_crop, images_ori)]` 
3. **Special tokenization** - Non-standard image token embedding
4. **Custom inference pipeline** - Requires their specific preprocessing

Standard Transformers VLM inference (`AutoProcessor + generate()`) is incompatible.

---

## What Was Attempted

### Successes ✅
- Model and dependencies installed correctly
- Model loads with GPU acceleration
- Processor loads successfully

### Failures ❌
- Image preprocessing incompatible with standard pipeline
- `processor(images=...)` fails with DeepSeek's custom processor
- Inference requires completely custom pipeline

---

## Effort Required

To make Transformers support work:
- **Time**: 4-8 hours minimum
- **Complexity**: Reverse-engineer DeepSeek's image preprocessing
- **Maintenance**: Keep up with DeepSeek OCR's custom architecture

**Not worth it** when GGUF is already working well.

---

## Recommendation

**Use GGUF models only.** 

For safetensors models:
- Use DeepSeek OCR's official demo/tools
- Wait for official GGUF quantized release
- Find alternative OCR models with GGUF support

---

## Files Created (Can Be Removed)

These files were created during the attempt but can be safely removed:

- `ocr_project/ocr_engine_transformers.py`
- Model files in `/home/nico/LMStudio/deepseekOCR/` were modified (imports fixed for standalone use)

**Action**: Keep model imports fixed (they might be useful), but don't pursue Transformers integration.
