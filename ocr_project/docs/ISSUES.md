# OCR Project - Open Issues

This document tracks only **open** and **unresolved** issues that require decisions, clarification, or implementation. Resolved issues and decisions are documented in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## ðŸŽ¯ Decisions Needed Right Now

These are the issues that need your input **before** or **during** v0.1 implementation:

### 1. Testing Strategy - Use Case Review (Issue #5)
**Status**: AWAITING YOUR REVIEW  
**Action**: Review and refine the 10 proposed test use cases  
**Location**: See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) Testing Strategy section  
**Priority**: Should be finalized before implementing v0.1 tests

---

### 2. Pan-and-Scan Implementation (Issue #15)

**Status**: âœ… **DECISION MADE** - Try native support with fallback  
**Priority**: HIGH - User expects many files larger than 896x896

**Implementation Strategy** (per user decision):
- **Try First**: Use `do_pan_and_scan=True` in AutoProcessor for images >896x896
- **If it works**: Great! Use native support
- **If it fails**: Implement fallback to manual tiling strategy
- **Error Handling**: Catch exceptions and gracefully fall back

**Implementation Notes**:
- Test during v0.1 implementation
- Log which method was used (native vs manual tiling)
- Manual tiling implementation details will be determined if needed

---

### 3. PDF Processing Strategy (Issue #6)
**Status**: POST v0.1 TESTING - Awaiting your testing  
**Action**: After v0.1 is complete, test PDF processing and report results  
**Priority**: Can be deferred until v0.1 is done

## All Open Issues Requiring Decisions

### Issue #1: Vault Merger Integration

**STATUS**: ðŸ“‹ **DEFERRED to v0.5** - Design decisions needed

**Open Questions**:
- Define exact integration API signature
- Determine integration point in vault merger workflow (after merge? after deduplication?)
- Should OCR files be excluded from deduplication process?
- How should OCR files be handled in link mapping?

**Plan**: Address during v0.5 development per roadmap

---

### Issue #2: Hash-Based Duplicate Detection Implementation

**STATUS**: ðŸ“‹ **SPECIFIED for v0.2** - Logic defined, implementation pending

**Specification** (per DECISIONS.md):
- Calculate SHA-256 hash (first 8 characters)
- Check hash in existing filenames
- Skip if found in OCR file, continue if found in non-OCR file
- Log both scenarios

**Open Implementation Questions**:
- How to efficiently search for hash in filenames (directory scanning strategy)?
- Hash collision handling strategy (extremely rare but possible)
- Content verification option (should it be implemented)?

**Priority**: v0.2 implementation

---

### Issue #5: Testing Strategy - Use Case Review

**STATUS**: ðŸ“‹ **AWAITING USER REVIEW** - Use cases proposed, need refinement

**Current State**: 10 test use cases proposed (see DECISIONS.md Testing Strategy section)

**Action Required**: User to review, edit, and approve test use cases before implementation

**Next Step**: User will review and refine the proposed test use cases

---

### Issue #6: PDF Processing Strategy

**STATUS**: ðŸ“‹ **POST v0.1 TESTING** - Decision pending after testing

**Current Plan**:
- User will test PDF processing using v0.1 prototype once completed
- Test if Gemma 3-12b-it accepts PDF input natively
- Decision on approach will be made based on test results

**Open Questions** (to be answered after testing):
- Does VLM handle PDFs natively or require conversion?
- If conversion needed, what library/approach?
- Multi-page PDF handling strategy?
- Should PDF support be in v0.1 or deferred?

**Action**: Test after v0.1 completion, then decide approach

### Issue #15: Pan-and-Scan Implementation

**STATUS**: âœ… **STRATEGY DECIDED** - Try native support, fallback if needed

**Implementation Approach** (per user decision):
- **Primary**: Use `do_pan_and_scan=True` in AutoProcessor when processing images >896x896
- **Fallback**: If native support fails (exception/error), implement manual tiling
- **Testing**: Will be tested during v0.1 implementation

**If Native Support Works**:
- Use `do_pan_and_scan=True` parameter
- Document successful usage
- No manual implementation needed

**If Fallback Needed**:
- Implement manual tiling strategy
- Determine tile size and overlap percentage (likely 896x896 tiles with overlap)
- Text merging strategy to avoid duplicates
- Tile stitching approach
- Handle text split across tiles
- Log which method was used for each image

**Priority**: High - needed for v0.1 to handle user's large image files
