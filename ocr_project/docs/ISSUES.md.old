## Critical Issues & Errors

### Issue #1: Missing Integration with Vault Merger

**STATUS**: ðŸ“‹ **DEFERRED** - Planned for v0.5 per roadmap

**Recommendation** (for v0.5 implementation):
- Define integration API:
  - Function: `process_vault_images(vault_path, config_path=None)`
  - Return format: List of processed markdown files with metadata
- Add OCR processing phase to vault merger workflow:
  - Scan vault for image files
  - Process images through OCR
  - Create markdown files with `{image_name}_OCR_{hash}.md` format
  - Update link mapping to include OCR-generated files
- Consider adding OCR option flag: `--process-images` or `--ocr`

**Note**: Following incremental development approach - integration comes after core OCR functionality is proven.

### Issue #2: Hash-Based Duplicate Detection Logic

**Current Requirement** (per user specification):
- When processing an image, calculate its hash
- Check if that hash appears in any existing filename in the vault
- If hash found in filename, determine if it's an OCR-generated file:
  - **If filename contains OCR results** (e.g., `*_OCR_{hash}.md` pattern):
    - Skip OCR processing for this image
    - Log: "Skipped {image_path}: Hash {hash} already exists in OCR file {existing_file}"
  - **If hash exists in non-OCR filename**:
    - Continue with OCR processing (hash collision or unrelated file)
    - Log: "Processing {image_path}: Hash {hash} found in non-OCR file {existing_file}, continuing"
- Store all hash detections in processing log for audit trail

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Detect OCR file pattern: `{original_name}_OCR_{hash}.md` or similar
- Check filename for hash substring (8 characters per RULES.md)
- Log both scenarios with clear distinction
- Continue processing even if hash found in non-OCR file (don't skip)

**Additional Considerations**:
- Hash collision handling (different images, same hash - extremely rare but possible)
- Content verification option (compare actual file contents for exact match)
- Force re-processing flag (override hash detection)

---

## Major Omissions

### Issue #3: Error Handling Strategy

**STATUS**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Strategy defined per user specification

**Error Handling Strategy** (per user specification):

**Fatal Errors (Abort Entire Process)**:
- **Model loading failure**: If model cannot be loaded, abort entire process immediately
  - Log error: "FATAL: Model loading failed - {error_details}. Aborting process."
  - Exit with error code
  - Do not attempt to process any images

**Recoverable Errors (Continue Processing)**:
- **Corrupted image file**: If single image is corrupted, skip only that image
  - Log error: "ERROR: Image {filename} is corrupted - {error_details}. Skipping this image."
  - Continue processing remaining images
  - Record skipped image in processing log with reason

**Fallback Strategy** (for all recoverable errors):
- Implement fallback mechanisms where possible:
  - **Inference timeout**: Retry with shorter max_tokens or reduced batch size
  - **Memory exhaustion**: Fallback to CPU processing or reduce image resolution
  - **Network errors** (if using remote models): Retry with exponential backoff
  - **Partial batch failure**: Process successful images, log failures, continue
  - **Image format unsupported**: Try conversion via Pillow, skip if conversion fails

**Error Logging**:
- All errors logged to processing log file (`ocr_processing_log.md`)
- Include: timestamp, error type, file affected, error details, action taken (skip/retry/abort)
- Fatal errors also logged to console/stderr with clear message

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Try-catch blocks around all critical operations
- Model loading: Validate before processing begins
- Image processing: Validate individually, skip on corruption
- Logging: Structured error entries in markdown log format

### Issue #4: Logging and Observability

**STATUS**: âœ… **STRATEGY DEFINED** - Recommendations approved

**Logging Strategy**:
- Use Python `logging` module with structured format (JSON)
- Implement log levels: DEBUG â†’ INFO â†’ WARNING â†’ ERROR â†’ CRITICAL
- Add processing metrics: images processed, success rate, average time per image
- Consider adding progress bars using `tqdm` (already in dependencies)
- Add optional integration with monitoring (if needed in future)

**Implementation Plan**:
- Processing log: `ocr_processing_log.md` (markdown format for human readability)
- Technical log: Configurable log file for debugging (if `log_file` specified)
- Log rotation: Implement file size-based rotation for technical logs
- Structured logging: Use JSON format for technical logs, markdown for processing log

### Issue #5: Testing Strategy Missing

**Proposed Testing Strategy**:

**Test Structure**:
- Create `tests/` directory with structure mirroring main code
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual modules
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for full pipeline
- `tests/test_data/` - Sample test images and fixtures
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test configuration files, mock data

**Test Use Cases** (to be refined by user):

1. **Single Image OCR (v0.1 Core Functionality)**
   - Input: Single image file (JPG)
   - Expected: Markdown file with extracted text
   - Verify: Text is extracted, saved correctly, printed to console
   - Edge cases: Empty image, image with no text, very large image

2. **Model Loading and Initialization**
   - Input: Model identifier
   - Expected: Model loads successfully
   - Verify: Model is in correct device, processor initialized
   - Edge cases: Invalid model ID, insufficient GPU memory, network failure (for remote models)

3. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Input: Various image formats (JPG, PNG, different sizes)
   - Expected: Images normalized to 896x896, processed correctly
   - Verify: Format conversion, resizing, normalization
   - Edge cases: Corrupted files, unsupported formats, extremely large images

4. **Hash-Based Duplicate Detection (v0.2)**
   - Input: Image with hash matching existing OCR file
   - Expected: Processing skipped, logged appropriately
   - Verify: Hash calculation, file pattern matching, logging
   - Edge cases: Hash collision, non-OCR file with same hash

5. **Error Handling**
   - Input: Corrupted image file
   - Expected: Error logged, image skipped, processing continues
   - Verify: Error logging, graceful degradation
   - Edge cases: Model loading failure (abort), memory exhaustion

6. **CSV Tracking (v0.2)**
   - Input: Successful OCR operation
   - Expected: Entry added to CSV with hash, filename, summary
   - Verify: CSV format, data accuracy, concurrent writes
   - Edge cases: CSV file locked, disk full, invalid data

7. **Configuration Management**
   - Input: Valid/invalid YAML configuration
   - Expected: Valid config loads, invalid config rejected with clear errors
   - Verify: Parameter validation, default values, type checking
   - Edge cases: Missing required fields, invalid types, out-of-range values

8. **Batch Processing**
   - Input: Directory with multiple images
   - Expected: All images processed, results saved, progress tracked
   - Verify: Batch handling, error isolation, progress reporting
   - Edge cases: Mixed valid/corrupted files, very large batches

9. **Prompt Customization**
   - Input: Custom OCR prompt in config
   - Expected: Custom prompt used for inference
   - Verify: Prompt loaded from config, logged, used in model inference
   - Edge cases: Empty prompt, very long prompt, special characters

10. **Output Quality**
    - Input: Image with known text content
    - Expected: Extracted text matches or is close to known content
    - Verify: OCR accuracy, text formatting, structure preservation
    - Edge cases: Handwriting, poor quality scans, multi-language text

**Test Data Requirements**:
- Sample test images (various formats, qualities, languages)
- Known-good reference outputs for accuracy testing
- Corrupted/invalid files for error testing
- Configuration templates for different scenarios

**Testing Framework**:
- Use pytest (already in dependencies)
- Mock model inference for unit tests (avoid loading full model)
- Integration tests can use small test model or mocked responses
- Consider golden files for regression testing
- CI/CD: Run tests on PR, fail on test errors

**Implementation Priority**:
- Start with use cases #1, #2, #3 for v0.1 (basic functionality)
- Add use cases #4, #5, #6 for v0.2 (duplicate detection, logging)
- Expand to remaining use cases as features are implemented

### Issue #6: PDF Processing Details Missing

**STATUS**: ðŸ“‹ **POST v0.1 TESTING** - User will test PDF processing after v0.1 completion

**Approach** (per user specification):
- **Testing Plan**: User will test PDF processing using v0.1 prototype once it's completed
- Attempt to run Gemma 3-12b-it directly on PDF files using the working v0.1 implementation
- Test if VLM accepts PDF input natively via AutoProcessor
- Document results and VLM behavior
- User will provide feedback on VLM PDF capabilities after testing
- Decision on PDF processing strategy will be made based on test results

**Implementation Options** (to be determined after testing):
- **If VLM handles PDFs natively**: Use directly, no conversion needed
- **If VLM requires conversion**: Implement PDF â†’ image conversion workflow

**Future Implementation** (if PDF conversion needed):
- Add `pdf2image` library for PDF processing
- Implement PDF â†’ image conversion:
  - Extract all pages as images
  - Process each page separately
  - Combine results or save separately
- Add configuration: `pdf_dpi`, `pdf_first_page_only` option
- Consider: Separate workflow for PDFs vs single images

**Action**: After v0.1 completion, user will test PDF processing, then we'll determine the approach based on results

### Issue #7: Concurrent Processing Strategy

**Issue**: Configuration mentions `batch_size` and `max_workers` but:
- No implementation strategy for concurrent processing
- No thread safety considerations
- No resource management strategy
- No strategy for GPU sharing if multiple workers

**Recommendation**:
- Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor`
- Consider: Model loading is expensive - should be shared across workers
- Implement model singleton pattern for multi-threaded access
- Add thread-safe CSV writing
- Consider async/await pattern if using API-based models

### Issue #8: Configuration Validation Missing

**Issue**: Config manager TODO mentions validation but no rules defined.

**Missing Validation For**:
- Model path/file existence
- Output directory writability
- Image format support
- Parameter ranges (e.g., temperature 0-2, max_tokens > 0)
- Required vs optional parameters
- Type validation (e.g., batch_size must be int)

**Recommendation**:
- Implement `pydantic` models for configuration validation
- Add schema validation for YAML config
- Provide clear error messages for invalid config
- Add `--validate-config` flag to check config without running

---

## Optimizations

### Issue #9: Model Loading Optimization

**Issue**: Model loading is expensive and currently undefined when/how to load.

**Optimizations**:
- Implement lazy loading: Load model only when needed
- Add model caching: Keep model in memory between batches
- Consider model quantization: Use int4/int8 for memory efficiency (already configurable)
- Add model warm-up: Pre-load model during initialization
- Consider model offloading for large models (CPU offloading)

**Recommendation**:
- Create `ModelManager` singleton class
- Load once, reuse across all processing
- Add model unload option for memory cleanup

### Issue #10: Image Preprocessing Pipeline Optimization

**Issue**: Multiple preprocessing steps are mentioned but execution order unclear.

**Optimizations**:
- Optimize preprocessing order (operations that reduce data size first)
- Cache preprocessed images (if storage allows)
- Use GPU-accelerated preprocessing where possible (e.g., torchvision transforms)
- Batch preprocessing operations

**Recommendation**:
- Pipeline: Load â†’ Validate â†’ Resize â†’ Enhance â†’ Normalize
- Add preprocessing cache with TTL
- Measure preprocessing time separately for profiling

### Issue #11: Result Caching Strategy

**Issue**: Hash-based duplicate detection exists but no caching of intermediate results.

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Cache model outputs for identical images
- Cache preprocessed images
- Cache processor results

**Recommendation**:
- Implement filesystem-based cache with configurable location
- Add cache invalidation strategy (TTL, manual clear)
- Add `--clear-cache` option
- Consider cache format: JSON for metadata, binary for images

### Issue #12: Memory Management

**Issue**: No strategy for handling large images or out-of-memory scenarios.

**Optimizations**:
- Implement image chunking for very large images
- Use generator pattern for batch processing (lazy loading)
- Add memory monitoring and warnings
- Implement automatic image downscaling if memory threshold exceeded

**Recommendation**:
- Add `max_image_size_mb` configuration
- Implement progressive downscaling if memory issues detected
- Add memory profiling hooks

### Issue #13: Prompt Engineering for OCR

**Requirement** (per user specification):
- Make OCR prompt configurable in configuration file
- Allow users to customize prompt for their specific use cases

**Implementation**:
- Add `ocr_prompt` field to `config_template.yaml`
- Default prompt: "Extract all text from this image. Transcribe the text exactly as it appears."
- Support variable substitution if needed (e.g., for task-specific prompts)
- Log the prompt used for each OCR operation in the processing log

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
# OCR Parameters
ocr_prompt: "Extract all text from this image. Transcribe it exactly as it appears."
# Alternative prompts users might try:
# ocr_prompt: "What text is shown in this image? Return only the text content."
# ocr_prompt: "Perform OCR on this image and return all visible text."
```

**Future Enhancement**:
- Task-specific prompts (handwriting vs printed, structured vs unstructured)
- Prompt testing framework to evaluate effectiveness
- Template library with proven prompts for different scenarios

### Issue #14: Output Quality and Validation

**Issue**: No quality metrics or validation for OCR results.

**Recommendation**:
- Add confidence scores if model provides them
- Implement basic quality checks:
  - Minimum text length (filter empty results)
  - Character set validation (detect garbled output)
  - Language detection (optional)
- Add manual review flag for low-confidence results
- Consider confidence threshold in configuration

### Issue #15: Pan-and-Scan Implementation Details

**Issue**: Mentioned but no strategy for implementation.

**Current Understanding**: Break large images into overlapping tiles, process each tile, combine results.

**Recommendation**:
- Define tile size and overlap percentage
- Implement smart text merging (avoid duplicate text from overlaps)
- Add tile stitching strategy
- Consider: OCR context loss when text is split across tiles
- Add configuration: `pan_scan_tile_size`, `pan_scan_overlap_percent`

### Issue #16: CSV Tracking Optimization

**Issue**: CSV is mentioned but no implementation details for large-scale processing.

**Problems**:
- CSV appends can be slow with many entries
- No indexing strategy
- No query capabilities

**Recommendation**:
- Use SQLite instead of CSV for better performance (single file, indexed)
- Or: Use CSV but add periodic sorting/indexing
- Add: `--rebuild-index` option for CSV optimization
- Consider: Hybrid approach (SQLite for active processing, CSV export for compatibility)

---

## Security Considerations

### Issue #17: Input Validation and Security

**Missing**:
- File path validation (prevent path traversal attacks)
- Image file size limits (prevent DoS)
- Image format validation (prevent malicious files)

**Recommendation**:
- Use `pathlib.Path` for safe path handling
- Validate file extensions and MIME types
- Set maximum file size limits
- Sandbox image loading (catch exceptions from image libraries)

### Issue #18: Model Security

**Issues**:
- Loading arbitrary models from paths could be security risk
- No validation of model files

**Recommendation**:
- Validate model file checksums if using local models
- Use trusted model sources (Hugging Face Hub with verification)
- Document security considerations for local model files

---

## Documentation Gaps

### Issue #19: Setup Instructions Missing

**Current State**: "To be implemented"

**Required**:
- Python version requirements
- System dependencies (CUDA, etc.)
- UV installation and usage
- Model download instructions
- Configuration file creation
- First-run examples

### Issue #20: Usage Examples Missing

**Current State**: "To be implemented"

**Required**:
- Command-line examples
- Python API examples
- Configuration examples
- Batch processing examples
- Integration examples (vault merger)

### Issue #21: Configuration Documentation

**Issue**: `config_template.yaml` has parameters but no explanation.

**Required**:
- Document each configuration parameter
- Provide recommended values
- Explain trade-offs (e.g., batch_size vs memory)
- Add configuration examples for different use cases (fast vs accurate, local vs remote)

---

## Architectural Improvements

### Issue #22: Separation of Concerns

**Issue**: Some responsibilities overlap between modules.

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify boundaries:
  - `image_processor`: Only image I/O and preprocessing
  - `ocr_engine`: Only model interaction
  - `result_processor`: Only text post-processing
  - `main.py`: Only orchestration
- Avoid: Image processing logic in OCR engine
- Avoid: Text cleaning in image processor

### Issue #23: Dependency Injection

**Issue**: Modules will likely have tight coupling.

**Recommendation**:
- Use dependency injection for:
  - Model instances (allows mocking for testing)
  - Configuration (allows config overrides)
  - Logger (allows different log backends)
- Consider factory pattern for model loading

### Issue #24: Result Format Extensibility

**Issue**: Output format is configurable but implementation not extensible.

**Recommendation**:
- Create `ResultFormatter` interface/ABC
- Implement `MarkdownFormatter`, `JSONFormatter`, etc.
- Use factory pattern for format selection
- Allow custom formatters via plugin system

---

## Performance Considerations

### Issue #25: Batch Processing Strategy

**Issue**: Batch size mentioned but no strategy for efficient batching.

**Considerations**:
- Model inference may support variable batch sizes
- Some models batch better than others
- Memory constraints vs throughput trade-off

**Recommendation**:
- Implement adaptive batch sizing (start small, increase if memory allows)
- Profile different batch sizes for target hardware
- Add batch size recommendation based on model/hardware

### Issue #26: Progress Reporting

**Issue**: No strategy for progress updates during long-running operations.

**Recommendation**:
- Use `tqdm` (already in dependencies) for progress bars
- Add ETA calculations
- Add per-image progress for batch processing
- Add optional webhook/notification for completion

---

## Integration Improvements

### Issue #27: Vault Merger Integration Design

**Current State**: Mentioned but undefined.

**Design Proposal**:
```python
# In vault_merger main.py, add:
if config_manager.process_images:
    from ocr_project import process_vault_images
    logger.info("=== Phase 7: OCR Processing ===")
    ocr_results = process_vault_images(
        vault_path=config_manager.destination_path,
        config_path=config_manager.ocr_config_path
    )
    # OCR results are already saved as markdown files
    # Link processor will pick them up automatically
```

**Requirements**:
- Define `process_vault_images()` API
- Determine integration point (after merge? after deduplication?)
- Handle OCR files in link mapping
- Consider: Should OCR files be excluded from deduplication?

### Issue #28: Error Recovery Integration

**Issue**: No strategy for OCR failures in vault merger context.

**Recommendation**:
- OCR failures should not block vault merger
- Log OCR errors separately
- Provide summary of OCR processing in vault merger report
- Add flag: `--fail-on-ocr-error` (default: False)

---

## Missing Features

### Issue #29: Image Metadata Preservation

**Issue**: No plan to preserve image metadata (EXIF, creation date, etc.) in markdown output.

**Recommendation**:
- Extract metadata from images
- Add metadata frontmatter to generated markdown:
  ```markdown
  ---
  ocr_hash: abc12345
  source_image: image.jpg
  processed_date: 2024-01-01
  image_dimensions: 1920x1080
  ---
  [Extracted text]
  ```

### Issue #30: Language Detection

**Issue**: No strategy for handling multi-language text.

**Recommendation**:
- Add optional language detection (using `langdetect` library)
- Add language metadata to results
- Consider language-specific OCR prompts
- Add configuration: `detect_language`, `default_language`

### Issue #31: Structured Text Extraction

**Issue**: All text extraction is plain text, no structure preservation.

**Recommendation**:
- Detect lists, tables, headings in images
- Preserve structure in markdown output
- Add configuration: `preserve_structure` flag
- Consider: This may require specialized models or post-processing

---
