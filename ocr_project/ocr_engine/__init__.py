"""
Module for integrating with Vision Language Models for OCR functionality.
This module handles model loading, inference, and text extraction from images.
The system is designed to work with various Vision Language Models compatible 
with the Hugging Face Transformers library, with Google Gemma 3 (13B instruction-tuned) 
as the current primary model based on Hugging Face documentation.

Based on Hugging Face documentation for Gemma 3:
- Uses Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration for multimodal tasks
- Requires AutoProcessor for input processing
- Supports chat template format with image and text components
- Includes pan-and-scan capability for high-resolution images (do_pan_and_scan=True)
- Can handle multiple images in a single request
