OCR Module using Vision Language Models with Transformers library.

This module serves as the main implementation file that will coordinate OCR processing
using Vision Language Models (VLMs) compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library.
The system is designed to work with various models, with Google Gemma 3 (currently 13B 
instruction-tuned variant) as the primary model based on Hugging Face documentation.

Key responsibilities:
1. Load and initialize compatible vision language models (Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration)
2. Process images to extract text using multimodal capabilities
3. Handle image preprocessing and post-processing
4. Manage processor/tokenizer integration (AutoProcessor)
5. Provide interfaces for batch processing
6. Implement chat template formatting for multimodal input
7. Handle pan-and-scan for high-resolution images

Architecture:
- Image Input → Preprocessing → Model Inference → Text Extraction → Post-Processing → Output

Classes to be implemented:
- OCRProcessor: Main class to handle the OCR pipeline
- ImagePreprocessor: Handle image loading and preparation
- ModelHandler: Manage Vision Language Model operations (Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration)
- TextExtractor: Process model outputs to clean text
- ResultFormatter: Format and validate extracted text

Dependencies:
- transformers: For model integration
- torch: For model execution
- pillow/opencv: For image processing
- numpy: For numerical operations

Processing Pipeline:
1. Load image from file/storage
2. Preprocess image (resize, normalize, enhance)
3. Format image with text prompt using processor.apply_chat_template()
4. Run inference with selected Vision Language Model (Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration)
5. Extract text from model output
6. Clean and format the extracted text
7. Return results to caller

Key Implementation Details from Hugging Face Documentation:
- Use Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration and AutoProcessor
- Support for pan-and-scan option for high-resolution images (do_pan_and_scan=True)
- Use of chat template format with image and text components
- Support for multiple images in a single request
- Specific tokens like <start_of_image> for multimodal input
- Quantization options for memory efficiency

Configuration options to support:
- Model selection (any VLM compatible with Transformers)
- Current model: Google Gemma 3-13b-it (instruction-tuned variant, closest to requested 12B)
- Image processing parameters (size, enhancement, etc.)
- Inference parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- Output format (plain text, structured, etc.)
- Pan-and-scan option (do_pan_and_scan) for high-resolution images
